              I am currently taking a sabbatical from work.  I have worked for years as a researcher in integrated circuit fabrication.  Over the years, I branched out into working on engineered materials, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems),  nanotechnology, and even briefly on quantum entanglement theory.  One of the programs that I am most proud of having worked on was Meta-Materials and Negative Index Materials (NIM).  Few people are familiar with these materials, but Duke University believes they will one day be able to fabricate an invisibility cloak from these materials (any Harry Potter fans?).  I even fabricated a Meta-Material cube that made it onto the cover of Physics Today magazine.  Recently, I decided to challenge myself with programming, something I was only vaguely familiar with before this course.

              Aside from work, I love stand-up comedy.  I even met Trevor Noah on the streets of Seattle once.  I am also a bit of an adrenaline junkie.  I am a certified scuba diver, have been skydiving, have repelled off the side of a very large tree, and even flown a helicopter.  I also am a bit of a foody, I love to cook and of course eat.  Luckily, my daughter is also a foody.   You can see her photo with our oversized brunch on my profile page.
